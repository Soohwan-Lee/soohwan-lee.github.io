I am a Ph.D candidate in design at [UNIST](http://unist.ac.kr/), focusing on the intersection of HCI, AI, and social psychology. My research journey began at the [EXPC Lab](http://expc.unist.ac.kr) in 2019, where I developed a diverse background in CSCW, Human-centered AI, and cognitive & social psychology. Currently, I am investigating LLM-based agents and AI-mediated communication to improve group decision-making in complex group dynamics with social power & influence.

My work addresses a critical gap in existing design spaces by exploring and extending design dimensions necessary for adapting AI systems to accommodate group dynamics effectively. By integrating principles from HCI, design, social psychology, and AI, I aim to create systems that understand and respond to group needs, facilitating cohesive and meaningful interactions. My research aims to contribute to pushing the boundaries of how interactive systems can be designed and evaluated to ensure they are inclusive, intuitive, and effective for diverse user groups in both individual and collective contexts.

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
