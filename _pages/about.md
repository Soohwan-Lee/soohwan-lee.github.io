I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Expressive Computing Lab](https://expc.unist.ac.kr/), [Design](https://design.unist.ac.kr/) at [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/), specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Human-centered AI. I actively integrate insights from HCI, social psychology, and design to ensure AI technologies meaningfully support diverse user groups and their collective goals. My research broadly focuses on designing AI systems that facilitate effective and inclusive group decision-making, particularly from a social psychological perspective. I explore how AI can support group dynamics by enhancing critical thinking, balancing group discussions, and mediating social influence within collaborative environments.

My work critically addresses current limitations in Human-centered AI, which predominantly emphasizes interactions between individual users and single AI systems. To bridge this gap, I try to introduce concepts such as Group-centered AI and Group Experience (GX), advocating for design approaches specifically tailored to group dynamics and collective user experiences. My recent representative project involves developing an LLM-powered Devilâ€™s Advocate agent designed to amplify minority opinions in decision-making processes, promoting more inclusive and balanced group interactions. Building on this, I am now initiating research that investigates multi-agent systems and their social influence, developing adaptive chatbot facilitators for collaborative ideation, and designing AI-driven conflict mediation tools informed by game theory.

I love running, watching movies, and reading books in my free.

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.  -->
